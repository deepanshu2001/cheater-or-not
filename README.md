# cheater-or-not
in this program,there is a student deepanshu who is given the chance of creating multiplication table of a number so that the other students can look in the table while giving exams.So
in order to get better percentage of numbers than other students,deepanshu randomly places of of the answers of the table with the wrong number so that students lose marks.
No we have to create a function which will check whether the multiplication table given by deepanshu is correct or whether deepanshu cheated!
